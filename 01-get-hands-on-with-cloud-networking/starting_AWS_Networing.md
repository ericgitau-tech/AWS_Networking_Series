## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on networking series, I'm learning about how to design, secure, and connect virtual networks in the cloud. By the end of the 9 projects, I will have built a complete VPC architecture, configured private and public subnets, implemented security controls, and connected cloud resources efficiently.

I'm learning cloud networking because modern applications rely on scalable and secure cloud infrastructure, and understanding networking is key to architecting reliable systems and preparing for a career in cloud engineering.

Businesses traditionally had to build, manage, and maintain their own physical networks and data centers, which was expensive, time-consuming, and hard to scale. Cloud networking changed things by allowing companies to create, manage, and connect virtual networks in the cloud, giving them flexibility, scalability, and easier access to resources without owning physical hardware.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside 2 hours every day to work on this networking series, completing 2 projects per day, so I can finish all 9 projects in about 5 days. I will keep myself accountable by tracking my progress in a checklist, documenting each project with screenshots and notes, and creating portfolio-ready summaries. My reward is gaining practical cloud networking skills, building a strong portfolio, and boosting my career opportunities in cloud engineering.
By the end of this series, I will have:
a) Built a secure VPC architecture from scratch
b) Connected resources across different network environments
c) Implemented network security and monitoring
d) Created 9 pieces of portfolio-worthy documentation showcasing my skills

### What are networks?

Computer networks are groups of connected devices (like computers, servers, or smartphones) that communicate with each other to share data, resources, and services. Networks can be small, like a home Wi-Fi network, or large, like the internet, which connects millions of devices worldwide.

### What is a VPC?

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private, isolated section of the cloud where you can launch and manage your resources, like servers, databases, and applications. This helps organizations by providing full control over their network environment, including IP addressing, subnets, routing, and security, while keeping resources secure and scalable.
